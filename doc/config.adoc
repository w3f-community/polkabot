= Configuration

Before you can start {proj}, you will have to configure a few things. {proj} is using https://gitlab.com/chevdor/confmgr[confmgr]. 

You will need to create a file under packages/polkabot. This file should be named `.env` or `.env.foobar` if you start with `NODE_ENV=foobar`. As a test, you may start {proj} without any config and it will tell you what is missing. Many values have default, so you can get started with a very minimal configuration.

Look for the sample file under `packages/polkabot/.env-sample`.

== Configuration

{proj} uses 2 levels of configuration:

- the main config in src/config.js
- the plugin specific config in `src/plugins/.../config.js`
