ðŸŽ‚ Happy BlocthDay!!! The chain is now at block #1000000

In its first version, this plugin will only report Nth blocthdays. For instance for N=10, it would report block #10, #20, #30, etc... That can quickly become very annoying...

A newer version include several `checkers`. Checkers are in charge of deciding whether a given block is worth mentionning or not.

The current list of checkers is shown below in details.

== Checkers

=== Specials

Special is rather simple and allows the user defining a random list of worth-mentioning blocks. That can be for instance #42, #987654, or any other random block.

=== Nth

The Nth checker is now usually disabled by default with a value of 0. Setting its `NB_BLOCKS` configuration parameter to a value that is not 0 will bring back the original behavior.

=== Seq

The Seq checker is looking for 'funny' block numbers looking like `123`, `1234`, `12345`, etc...

=== Exp

The Exp checker is the less annoying evolution of the Nth checkers. It will only consider 'round' numbers such as #1000, #7000, #20000. 

NOTE: It will NOT consider #1100 as an interesting block.
