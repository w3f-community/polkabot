== Intro

image::doc/polkabot.png[width=300px]

You can see Polkabot in action in link:++https://matrix.to/#/#polkadot-network-status:matrix.org++[#polkadot-network-status:matrix.org]

Polkabot is an extensible bot for http://polkadot.network[Polkadot], running on http://matrix.org[Matrix.org]

NOTE: Polkabot aims as being *as silent as possible* so don't expect lots of fuzz and action!

== Install & Run

	git clone https://gitlab.com/chevdor/polkabot.git
	cd polkabot
	yarn

At that point, you will need to search for the `config-sample.js` files. Everywhere you find one, create a `config.js` and make sure you adapt the content. Once you think you are good:

	yarn start

== Docker images

To build the base and the custom:

	yarn docker

This will build the Polkabot main image and a custom image as specified in the `docker` folder.

Then, test with :

	yarn docker:run

== Configuration

Polkabot uses 2 levels of configuration:
- the main config in src/config.js
- the plugin specific config in `src/plugins/.../config.js`


include::CONTRIBUTING.adoc[]



=== Create plugins

Once you picked a name for your plugin, create a folder in `src/plugin`.

Your plugin can start with code similar to:

[source, js, indent=0, linenums]
----
include::doc/plugin.js[]
----

== Plugins

You can all the plugins in https://gitlab.com/Polkabot
