== Intro

You can see {proj} in action in:

- link:++https://matrix.to/#/#polkadot-network-status:matrix.org++[#polkadot-network-status:matrix.org]
- link:++https://matrix.to/#/#kusama-network-status:matrix.org++[#kusama-network-status:matrix.org]
- link:++https://matrix.to/#/#westend-network-status:matrix.org++[#westend-network-status:matrix.org]

You can also run {proj} yourself and the <<docker>> images that are available may help.

{proj} is an extensible bot for http://polkadot.network[Polkadot] and other Substrate based chains. It is mainly running on http://matrix.org[Matrix.org] but also handles notification with other networks such as twitter using dedicated plugins.

NOTE: {proj} aims as being *as silent as possible* so don't expect lots of fuzz and action!

== Install & Run

	git clone https://gitlab.com/chevdor/polkabot.git
	cd polkabot
	nvm use
	yarn
	yarn start

NOTE: For devs, the command is typically:

	NODE_ENV=dev LOG_LEVEL=silly yarn start

== Dev notes

You can find the API documentation at https://polkabot.gitlab.io/polkabot/

	yarn
	yarn-check
	yarn upgrade

Start your substrate node:

	docker run --rm -it --name polkadev -p 9944:9944 chevdor/polkadot:0.8.2 polkadot --dev --alice --rpc-cors all --unsafe-ws-external

then run:

	nvm use

Before you got further you need to check your config. This is a .env file and all variables start with `POLKABOT_`. 
By default, the running mode is 'production' and will pick the `.env` file. The following to the same:

	yarn start
	NODE_ENV=production yarn start
	
If you want to use another file such as `.env.dev`, you may use:

	NODE_ENV=dev y start


== Settingg the bot account

Matrix is changing quickly and e2e is now enabled by default. You will need to make an account for the bot and login a to get your recovery key and define your recovery passphrase. After that, e2e should work. 

WARNING: If you use a browser to login as the bot, you will automatically signal that the bot is 2e2 capable.. which it is not. After that, all invitations from Riot will be with encryption turned on. There is a workaround which is to create a new room without encryption, invite the bot (it will join automatically) and change the conversation level to 'Direct Message'.

== Encryption

Currently, Polkabot does NOT support encryption. If encryption is needed, https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon could be used as proxy.
